# Crue-Operations-Java
This project is a simple Java application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database. The application uses JDBC to connect to the database and perform the operations.
The main features of the application include:

User-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the database
Separate classes for database connection, data access, and application logic
Support for adding, updating, and deleting records in the database
Error handling for common database errors, such as duplicate records or invalid input
The application is built using Java version 8 and MySQL version 5.7. It can be easily imported into any Java IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ, for further development or customization.

This project is intended as a simple example of how to perform basic CRUD operations using Java and MySQL, and can be used as a starting point for building more complex database applications.
