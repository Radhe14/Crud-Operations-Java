# CRUD-Operations-Java
Java CRUD Operations for Employee Management
This project is a simple Java application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on an MySQL database for managing employee data. The application uses JDBC to connect to the database and perform the operations.

The main features of the application include:

User-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the employee data
Separate classes for database connection, data access, and application logic
Support for adding, updating, and deleting employee records in the database
Error handling for common database errors, such as duplicate records or invalid input
The application is built using Java version 8 and MySQL version 5.7. It can be easily imported into any Java IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ, for further development or customization
